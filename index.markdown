The presentations below were created by Kylie Warkentin to share with researchers her work to improve the transcription function of [Gentle](http://lowerquality.com/gentle/), a forced aligner, using recordings from SpokenWeb Montreal's ["The Sir George Williams University (SGW) Poetry Series"](https://montreal.spokenweb.ca/sgw-poetry-readings/) collection. The SENT metadata structure (Speaker, Environment, Notes, Transcription/Technology) used in these projects organizes the speakers in the recording, environmental factors that may have affected the quality of Gentle's transcription, miscellaneous notes about the recording, and Gentle's incorrect transcription of the recording (paired with the human-corrected version) into one embedded structure. For further explanation of this structure and its use, please view [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L_fElYnA96q4WQFVuBmSJ80hXSESYDoJ/view?usp=sharing), created by Kylie Warkentin.
